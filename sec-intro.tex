\section{Introduction}

Skeleton-based action recognition has emerged as a critical research 
direction in computer vision, driven by its applications in healthcare 
monitoring \cite{ntu}, human-computer interaction \cite{ntu120}, and surveillance systems \cite{ref3}.



The advent of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) \cite{ref8} revolutionized the field by 
explicitly modeling skeletal topology through adjacency matrices. Pioneering 
work like ST-GCN \cite{ref7} introduced spatial-temporal convolutions to jointly 
capture joint correlations across frames. Subsequent innovations proposed 
learnable adjacency matrices \cite{ref9,ref10} and multi-scale aggregation 
strategies \cite{multiscale} to enhance flexibility.Despite these advancements, 
two critical limitations persist: (1) While existing works predominantly focus on spatial topology modeling，
the temporal feature extraction relies on multi-scale convolutions 
that inadequately capture contextual dependencies across time. (2) Fixed prior topology inputs
enforce a static inductive bias that restricts the network's ability to discover latent action-specific correlations.


Therefore, this paper proposes a novel architecture that advances skeleton-based action recognition through three pivotal innovations:


First, we introduce a Temporal Element-wise Multiplication Cumsum 
Attention (TEMCA) mechanism to address temporal contextualization. 
While temporal modeling remains pivotal for skeleton-based action 
recognition, existing approaches predominantly rely on multi-scale temporal convolution modules \cite{ref9,ref10,ref11,ref12} that lack specialized architectural design for capturing complex temporal dependencies. To address this, we draw inspiration from the Token Statistic Transformer \cite{tost} to devise a multi-scale linear attention mechanism. Our TEMCA employs dilated context windows to 
establish hierarchical receptive fields, explicitly capturing both 
local motion nuances and global phase transitions.

Second, inspired by the activation-free method \cite{rewrite_stars}, we fundamentally redesign self-attention computation through activation-free element-wise multiplication, resolving the efficiency bottleneck of temporal modeling. 
While preserving attention's dynamic weighting capability, TEMCA 
accelerates training convergence compared to standard 
ToST variants, yet maintains state-of-the-art accuracy.

Third, we propose a multi-modal skeleton representation through latent 
topology discovery via line-graph augmentation. While multi-modal 
learning, such as joint-bone ensembles \cite{ref9,ref10,ref11,ref13} has proven 
effective in mitigating rigid structural priors, existing methods rely 
on simplistic feature engineering, training separate models on linearly 
transformed joint coordinates for late fusion. 
Building on this paradigm, we introduce line-graph augmentation, a 
novel skeletal modality that explicitly encodes angular kinematics 
between adjacent bones. The ensemble of line-graph has been demonstrated 
to capture richer semantic information, effectively boosting prediction 
accuracy.
